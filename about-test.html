          <h3>Nigerian Livestock Landscape</h3>
          <p>ABIS GROUP is spearheading a transformative initiative in livestock value-chain development. Despite Nigeria's livestock sector being valued at over ₦33 Trillion, it currently contributes less than 3% to the country's annual GDP. To address this untapped potential, ABIS GROUP is constructing a state-of-the-art Livestock Product Processing Facility in Abuja, designed to serve domestic and global markets, including the lucrative halal meat sector.</p>
